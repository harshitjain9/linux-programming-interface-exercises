- A message queue is a linked list of messages stored within the kernel and identified by a message queue identifier. 
- A new queue is created, or an already-created queue is opened, using **msgget()**
- New messages are added to the queue using **msgsnd()**
- Every message has a positive long integer type field, a nonnegative length, and actual data bytes which are passed when using msgsnd()
- Messages are fetched from a queue using **msgrcv()**
- All processes can exchange information through access to a common system message queue
- The sending process places a message to a queue which can be read by another process
- Each message is given an identifier so that process can select the appropriate message
- Process must share a common key in order to gain access to the queue in the first place
- **ftok()** - used to generate a unique key
- **msgctl()**- performs various operations on a queue, usually used to delete a queue
